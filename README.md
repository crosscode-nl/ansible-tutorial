# Ansible Tutorial

This repository contains the code used for the ansible tutorial. 

## Installation

This tutorial assumes an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installation, although other Debian based distributions *MIGHT* work. 

To prepare your host for this tutorial run the following command on your terminal. It will ask for your root password a few times.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crosscode-nl/ansible-tutorial/main/install.sh -qO - | bash -s
``` 

The script will also run your first Ansible playbook.
